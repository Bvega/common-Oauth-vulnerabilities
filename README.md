  What is a CSRF attack in OAuth?
A CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) attack in OAuth happens when a hacker tricks your browser into finishing a login process you didn’t start. The hacker tries to connect your login session to their account instead of yours. If this works, the hacker might be able to access your personal data or use your account.
How do we stop that?
We use something called the state parameter. Here's how it works:

1. Your app creates a random state value before starting the login process.
2. It sends that state with the login request to the OAuth provider (like Google).
3. After login, the OAuth provider sends the user back to your app along with the same state value.
4. Your app checks if the state it receives matches the one it sent.
   If they don’t match, something suspicious is going on—like a CSRF attack—and the login should be blocked.

  What is a redirect URI attack?
A redirect URI is the place the user is sent back to after logging in with OAuth. If this redirect is not checked carefully, it can be abused.
Example in plain terms:
Let’s say your app (exampleapp.com) allows users to post content, and it also supports OAuth login. If the app allows any page on exampleapp.com as a redirect, that’s dangerous.
An attacker could create a fake page like:
https://exampleapp.com/forum/fake-login.html
This page has hidden code that steals the login code from the URL. If the attacker tricks a user into logging in with OAuth and uses this fake page as the redirect, they can grab the code and break into the user’s account.
How to prevent it?
Only allow specific, pre-approved redirect URLs. Don’t allow wildcards or user-generated pages.

  Why use OAuth (like “Login with Google”)?
Because it’s easy for users. They don’t need to remember a new password. Logging in is fast and smooth.
But what’s the risk?
OAuth is hard to get right. If your app isn’t careful:
• Attackers can steal login codes using bad redirect URLs.
• Attackers can fake login requests with CSRF tricks if state isn’t used properly.
So what should devs do?
• Always validate redirect URIs strictly.
• Always use and verify the state parameter.
• Understand that using OAuth means you are trusting another service (like Google) for login—and that adds new risks you must handle.
